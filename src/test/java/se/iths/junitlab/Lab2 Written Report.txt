1) Which technique did you use to choose the test cases?
- White box Testing Technique

2) What assumptions have you made? That is, what decisions have you made and why?
For testing, I understand the functionality of the code. I have to test for specific tasks. Like Camel Case, Email or reverse. Each function has different functionality which I need to understand. I try to test each function with different Asserts. Each result gives me more understanding of the functionality of the code.


3) Did you find any bugs? So something that you think you need to investigate before you can put the system into production.
- No, I did not catch bugs. While I was writing test cases. I do some mistakes. But, I check the functions again. I try to investigate it and test it with more asserts with different results. 

4) What was the most difficult with the lab and why was it the most difficult?
- The difficult part was to understand the functionality of the lab. Once I understand the functionality, Then it was easy to write test cases.
